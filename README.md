# Kotlin Demo Inheritance

In Kotlin, inheritance is the mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from a parent class. The parent class is also known as the superclass or base class, while the class that inherits from it is known as the subclass or derived class.

To define a subclass in Kotlin, we use the : symbol followed by the name of the superclass.
